## MFPF Operational Analytics in Ready-Apps-for-Telecommunications

Background, 

Ready-Apps-for-Telecommunications is a full native Android application built by the Mobile Innovation Lab @ IBM. One of the application's features provides a telecommunication's customer an interface to customize their plan with instant feedback and changes. 

In American markets, telco providers such as AT&T and Verizon have a plan model which include recurring monthly charges and little to no customization. In South America, Europe and Asia Pacific some smaller telco providers are aggressive in this custom space and allow for custom offerings. The Ready-Apps-for-Telecommunications takes advantage of this custom space.

The Ready-Apps-for-Telecommunications provides a unique experience for telco customers ranging from power users to minimalists and each customer is able to tailor their plan accordingly. Customers are presented with personal offers, fine control on your monthly recurring bill and recharging data when nearing the end of a billing cycle.

 Fine grain control for a user means fine grain analytics for a telco.
 
Using MFPF Operational Analytics (OA) we are able to create and capture custom activities, new in MFPF 7.0, which show [user interactions](#user-interactions) and [business metrics](#business-metrics). We were able to log custom activities and display this information in Custom Chart, also new to Operational Analytics.
